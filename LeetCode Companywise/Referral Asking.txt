Hello Rohit,

How are you doing?

I’m Shri, a software engineer with 4+ YOE and a Master’s in CS from CSUF. Sorry for the cold message, but I’m applying for software positions at Adobe and noticed you work there. Would you be able to help with a referral? It would mean a lot, especially in today’s hiring climate.

Thanks & Regards,

Questions to ask:
1. Some experined professional has said the expeince from INdia would not count here, so its better to apply for new grad psotions in US? Do you think they are saying correct?
2. What do you think, will JPMC will consider my previous expeirncde or should i only target junior or entry level psotion only?
