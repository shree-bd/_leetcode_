Inquiry About Full Stack Software Engineer Role
Dear Arvin,

I hope you're doing fine!

My name is Shri, and I am reaching out to explore potential job opportunities in software engineering roles at your organization.

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science and have around 5 years of experience in software engineering. I am keen on transitioning into full-stack development or related domains. My expertise lies in developing and managing microservices using Java, Python, JavaScript, SQL, and various cloud technologies. I also have solid experience with front-end technologies and a comprehensive understanding of full-stack development principles.

I am available for immediate full-time employment as well as contractual roles and do not require sponsorship. I would greatly appreciate any insights or advice you might have on current opportunities or the best way to apply within your organization.

I have attached my resume for your review. Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Best regards,
Shri B
